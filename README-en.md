[2018/04/20 update]

Although programmers don't have many girlfriends (mistakes), the overhead is often not small.
VPS, domain names, a bunch of paid software on the Mac, and those devices that Apple updates every year are often the rhythm of insufficient kidneys.

Fortunately, as programmers, we have more positions to make money.

Some classmates should talk about it: Isn't it just a private order.
Yes, but not quite right. It is indeed a simple and direct way to make a private order, but in my opinion, the input-output ratio of the private order is very poor and it is not optimal.
But since it's mentioned, let's talk about it first.

## Private list

### Remote Outsourcing

The most ideal list is to directly access overseas projects, such as [freelance.com] (http://freelance.com) and other websites. On the one hand, it is more cost-effective to earn US dollars. Before, I saw that projects such as writing payment and sending registration codes to WordPress can be completed in one weekend, and can also be US $ 200 ~ 300. On the other hand, Foreign orders are hidden.

Commonly used foreign websites:

-http://odesk.com
-http://freelancer.com
-http://elance.com

There is also a software crowdsourcing platform [CODING code city] (https://mart.coding.net) in China. Cloud software development platform [Coding.net] (https://coding.net) based on cloud computing technology as a communication and supervision tool, quickly connects developers and demanders, and aims to improve the software through cloud crowdsourcing Efficiency of delivery. As a third-party supervision platform, Code City will review all projects to ensure the clarity of project requirements, and provide payment guarantees, so that developers can get compensation as long as they complete project development on time. You can [here] (https://mart.coding.net/codersay) to see the developer's evaluation of the code market.

Of course, I won't say much about the station of Zhu Bajie, which is not suitable for professional programmers to devalue themselves.

### Hire on demand

On-demand employment is a new form of private ordering in recent years. Developers go directly to the employer's office in their spare time and receive compensation on time. This method saves the inefficiency of network communication, avoids bargaining with employers, and is suitable for programmers who are afraid of trouble.

#### La Gou Dao (offline)

~~! [] (https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/40dfde6fgy1fqitltwcraj21350rd1f7.jpg) ~~

~~ [大 鲲] (https://pro.lagou.com/) Launched by Lagou. Considering that there are more than 300,000 recruiters on Lagou, Dabao has no shortage of employers, which is relatively weak in other independent platforms. The place. ~~

#### Realization Network

! [] (https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/40dfde6fgy1fqitorqndoj21350rd4am.jpg)

[Realization Network] (http://shixian.com) The price is also very good, but I strongly recommend that you do not reveal the real name and real company department information in the introduction, because this is too high-profile. Some classmates said, this is my weekend time, I can use it as much as I like, and the company can sue me?
Although many companies do not prohibit part-time employment in their labor contracts, such high-profile private work on the Internet is simply provoking HR: "I don't have enough work" and "the company doesn't have enough overtime" ...
Imagine that while you are telling the product manager that this demand can't be completed, you have time to make a private order. If you are the boss, you do n’t want to promote such a person. ~~

(I revisited in the past few days. The talent page no longer displays the name, only the avatar is used. This way, as long as you pay attention to the work experience introduction, you can avoid the above problems.)

#### Programmer's Inn

Not very familiar with it, but there are not many websites that are hired on demand in China, write them for your reference.




## Side Project

It is more cost-effective to do a Side Project than to do a private order.

The benefit of Side Project is that you only need to invest continuously in a specific area to earn income for a long time. This allows your knowledge to branch and grow on a tree, thereby forming a good knowledge structure, rather than turning into a bottle of outsource oil.

There are two ideas:

One is to be small and beautiful, develop a functional application for a segmented field, and then sell it on the market;

The other is to build a large and comprehensive basic application (think WordPress), which is convenient for others to directly add code on it and customize it to the application they want.

The former is faster to do, but you need to do some sales work yourself; the latter is usually an open source / free + charge model, which is easier to promote.

Some classmates will say that the Side Project I wrote just can't be sold. The selection of the project direction is indeed more skillful, but the simple and rude solution is to find a project that sells very well but the products and technology are not good, and make a competitive product that only costs half the price.

For example, there is a very famous writing software for Mac called Ulysses. I tried it very well, but it was expensive, 283 RMB. Later, I saw Mweb. The free Lite version only covers the main functions of Ulysses, and the full version is only 98RMB. I bought it without thinking.

## Consulting

### Expert Platform

If you have a small reputation in the technology circle, or are particularly proficient in a certain business, then making money through consulting is an easier way. Talk to people at the cafe for a few hours, and hundreds or thousands of dollars will be available.

I know the following domestic products:

-[On the line] (http://www.zaih.com/app/): This is a fruit shell, made earlier, and the content is industry-wide, so the technology above is not much.
-~ [Yuanchuangpai] (http://q.ycpai.com/h5/lightPartner/expertList): The light partnership column of Yuanchuangpai is mainly for entrepreneurs, suitable for technical experts who like to feel the entrepreneurial atmosphere. ~~
-~~ [极 牛] (http://geekniu.com/): You can think of this as a programmer's version of "On the Line". I checked it, although the number of appointments is much lower than on the line. However, they are more professional, and I hope they can promote them as soon as possible. ~~
-~~ [知 加] (http://get.ftqq.com/353.card): This project is my participation. It is for programmers. It is similar to the "voice answering" paid voice question and answer. There are some classmates from Silicon Valley technology companies. Those interested can take a look. ~~

Although consulting is also a real name, it is completely different from private work. The short consultation time will not affect the normal rest, and will not affect work. Moreover, most companies encourage technical exchanges, so everyone's acceptance is very high.

### Paid community

In addition to the APP, I think the charging group can also do it. For example, you can set up a technology entrepreneurship group, find some students who have successfully started a business, students who have invested, and students who have done business. They are open to students who want to start a business. Then all the problems you encounter in the process of starting a business can be answered by someone, and you will not feel alone. If a problem is encountered, the people in the group can answer it; if it does not, it is better. It feels like selling insurance, hahaha.

A better tool is [Knowledge Planet] (https://www.xiaomiquan.com), which is the previous small circle. This tool is more suitable for communication and discussion, and long articles are more painful. You can post it elsewhere and paste it back.

! [] (https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/40dfde6fgy1fqitxalj1gj20wd0rdtke.jpg)

Another reliable tool is probably V + members of Weibo. It is said that it is reliable because it is on Weibo, so it is equivalent to integrating the entire process of "content distribution" → "new fan acquisition" → "paying user conversion".

PS: One of the more difficult things in the exchange-type paid community is that it is difficult to balance the relationship between free fans and the paid community, so my final choice is to provide the entire content in the paid category, such as sorting into Small books, recorded actual combat videos, etc .; and daily fragmentary data sharing is still put on Weibo, an open and free platform.

## write an essay

### Contributions

Many students like to write technical blogs. In fact, there are fees for submitting articles to some websites.
For example, InfoQ, their family likes to receive 3000 ~ 4000 words of in-depth technical articles; the writing fee is 150 words. Although not too much, the cost of a long article is enough to buy an entry-level Cherry keyboard. What I like about InfoQ is that their copyright requirements are more relaxed. After the article is published on their website, you can publish it to your own blog; moreover, the article can be used for publishing, as long as it indicates that it was originally published on InfoQ.

A more detailed description can be found here: [http://www.infoq.com/cn/article-guidelines](http://www.infoq.com/cn/article-guidelines)

> [@Rambone] (http://weibo.com/rambone) of Weibo added that articles can also be sent to platforms that support rewards, such as Weibo, WeChat, and Jianshu. Considering [Jianshu CEO and his official blog's wonderful attitude towards programmers] (https://weibo.com/2855893887/Fztyzmolp?type=comment#_rnd1524187028824), my personal suggestion is to write articles for our programmer's own platform.

### Publishing

By the way, compared to writing articles, in fact, publishing books through traditional distribution channels does not make much money. The royalties I received before are 8%. If I sell them through the Internet and other channels, the number will be lower. The e-book income will be better, I have written an article specifically about "[How to publish a small book through the Internet] (http://get.ftqq.com/6914.get)"

I have been writing books based on graphics and text, and it is very good to use Markdown. However, I have recently started to write technical tutorial books, and found that Markdown is not enough. The main problems are ① video tags are not supported, especially local video solutions② The code highlighting is very troublesome. ③ There is no footer note or preset in the text description area.

Here I would highly recommend [Asciidoc] (http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/), you can think of it as an enhanced version of Markdown, preset a lot of commonly used formats And GitBook directly supports this format (as long as .md is made into .adoc), Atom also has a real-time preview plugin. After using it for a while, I really like it.

### Paid essays

In the past year, many paid essays appeared, which can be regarded as an online version of traditional publishing. Generally, a series of articles with less than ten articles is priced at half to one-third of traditional computer books. Paid anthology products are usually exclusively licensed, so care must be taken in choosing a platform, otherwise a good work may be pitted.

#### Nuggets booklet

! [] (https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/40dfde6fgy1fqiu8hul4nj21350rd7el.jpg)

[小 书] (https://juejin.im/books) is a paid essay product launched by Nuggets. I was the first author of this booklet, and it worked well all the way. The article format uses Markdown directly, and it can be updated in real time after publishing to ensure the freshness of the content, which is very convenient. The general price of the booklet is 19 ~ 29, the general content can sell well over 1,000, and the subdivided content can basically exceed 100. It is a very good choice for pocket money.

#### Master class

! [] (https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/40dfde6fgy1fqiue92vflj210l0rdqdb.jpg)

[Daren Class] (http://gitbook.cn/gitchat/columns) is a paid essay product under GitChat, which should now be merged into CSDN. Git

Chat's user base is not large, but the willingness to pay is okay, probably because the content is not free. When I was in class before, I submitted the documents after the completion to the editor, and the editors manually put them on the shelf. Feeling troublesome, especially correcting typos or something.

## Teaching videos

> [@ 瓜瓜 射门 啦] (http://weibo.com/cuteblackmelon) of Weibo gave his experience as a lecturer of the application program teaching website: a lecturer of the application program teaching website, a video + homework tutorial, the platform pays by the hour I do n’t know if it ’s pocket money. I counted last year. I produced about 20 hours of video a year and I got less than 60,000. I usually spend time on weekends.


After teaching online, you can make money by recording instructional videos. The benefits of recording online courses have never been known to programmers. But recently I talked with the students of [51CTO Academy] (http://edu.51cto.com/) and [NetEase Cloud Class] (http://study.163.com/smartSpec/intro.htm#/smartSpecIntro) I found an excellent micro-professional course with 40-60 sessions, and the revenue in one year is comparable to that of senior directors in first-tier cities. No wonder so many people have been training recently

### Channels and share

Most of the platform contracts have confidentiality agreements, so they cannot be talked to. However, [Netease Cloud Class] (https://study.163.com) and [Udemy] (https://www.udemy.com/) have stated the division in the public lecturer registration agreement, so let's talk about it here.

#### Netease Cloud Class

NetEase's courses are divided into three categories:

-Independent listing: It is equivalent to the platform provided by NetEase (video upload management, user management, payment system, etc.), and you are responsible for marketing. The share ratio is 9: 1, and the platform charges a 10% technical service fee. I find it very cost effective.
-Excellent class: Netease will help you promote it, but you need to sign an independent contract with them, and you will receive more shares. The most troublesome is usually the exclusive license. Once signed, courses cannot be listed on other platforms.
-Micro-professional: This is a course system planned by NetEase itself, and it is necessary to communicate with them in depth from the planning stage of the course. It is also a category of courses that NetEase promotes the most and earns the most.

The full sugar cube class is on the NetEase platform. The good things are as follows:

-The payment channels are relatively comprehensive, and it also supports Huayan, which is very important for high-priced courses like mine. Apple in-app purchase course channel fees will be deducted by Apple 30%, I really want to turn off 🤣
-Comes with a promotion system, which can be used as a course agent system if you like.

#### Udemy

In comparison, Udemy is very expensive, and the split is 5: 5; domestic users can only pay by paypal with credit card or bank card. But the curriculum can be rolled out globally. (But I ca n’t speak in English yet)

Tencent's class has never been used, and familiar classmates PR are welcome.

### Small and big lessons

I personally like to divide the video into two lessons and big lessons. Because the video may seem short, in fact, if you want to do a good job, there is still a lot of time and effort behind it. A big lesson is tens or hundreds of lessons. Most programmers at work have no time to record. Therefore, earning pocket money is more suitable for small classes. Such classes generally take a few hours and are edited into about 10 small classes. The price is in the hundreds of dollars. If you are in a professional and skilled field, a long vacation can be done.

### Manifestations

In terms of course performance, I personally prefer [designcode.io] (http://designcode.io) this kind of graphic + video mode. On the one hand, learners can quickly flip through and quickly skip what they have learned. Knowledge; on the other hand, there will be more long-channel promotion channels such as Weibo headlines, WeChat public accounts, Zhihu and Jianshu columns.

! [] (https://ws1.sinaimg.cn/large/40dfde6fgy1fqivfpkhw2j20ym0rdahv.jpg)

Of course, the content itself is the core. With so many free videos now, why should you buy your paid version?

In fact, most of the teaching videos nowadays are really just teaching, which are completely different from the problems we encounter in the real world. Inside are a bunch of simplified fake projects that are deliberately designed for teaching.

Here I share with you an idea I wanted to operate before.

Just after I decided to start an open source project, I used screen recording software to record the whole process completely. Open source screen recording tool [OBS] (https://obsproject.com/download), 1920 * 1080 screen is recorded in FLV format, only 1G per hour, a T hard drive can record thousands of hours, for a medium It's enough for the project.

When the project is finished, open source it on GitHub, let everyone use it first. After the iteration is stable, a series of tutorials are cut out from the full video recorded, a series of articles are organized, and paid courses are put on the website.

There are several benefits to this:

 -Ensure that all problems encountered are real, not imagined. Those who have studied this course can independently complete the entire project.
 -There is no intentional recording process, so the tutorial is actually a by-product of software development, with a higher input-output ratio.
 -If your software is really well written, then people who have used your software can become your customers or referees.
 
### Follow up

This year, when I recorded the [Fangtang Full Stack Class] (https://quanzhanke.github.io/), I adopted the above idea and it worked well, but there were a few minor problems:

-Continuity. There is always a potential anxiety when writing videos while recording videos. I usually write for a while and rest for a while, leaving a large blank space when recording, which is a waste of space. Of course this is mainly psychological.
-Recording. The problem with recording is even greater. Because a long-term project is difficult to be in a quiet environment all the time, and the recording of basic courses may require a lot of explanations. I wrote it down for a few hours. The final solution is to re-dub when editing, but you need to pay attention to the synchronization of audio and video.
 
### Software

If there is not much interface switching course, you can use the recording provided by keynote. Videos of the demos in other environments can be pasted directly into keynote for playback.

But when you have a lot of external interfaces, you need to record screens. You can use quicktime to record directly on Mac. File, just select record screen inside.

When I recorded the full stack lesson, because I would record some interfaces on three operating systems, I chose obs. Although this tool is mainly for live broadcast, its recording function is actually quite good.

For editing, it is basically enough to use imovie for mac. The main function is to split the segment, and then delete the unwanted ones. Remove the noise from the audio. Some clips that are waiting too long are accelerated. Of course, adobe's is fine, it's expensive.

### Hardware

On the hardware, it is best to buy a stand to support the microphone. Do not hold the microphone directly to record, so there will be no current sound (or very little). I used XOX for the external sound card, which works well under Mac, but I don't know why the echo is bigger on Windows (of course, it may also be the reason for system settings).

## Internal recommendation and headhunting recommendation

If you work for a top-tier Internet company such as BAT, if you have a group of like-minded programmer friends, then basically every few months you should meet colleagues and friends who want to change jobs, so do n’t miss your earnings Great time for referral fees.

Generally speaking, the money recommended by the company will be less, most of the 3000 ~ 6000 I have seen. But because it is its own company, it will be more reliable, so the risk is less. Recommending talents to the company often will also improve your favorability. If you can give priority, you have priority.

Compared to internal recommendations, headhunters recommend a much higher referral fee. A programmer with an annual salary of 300,000 can get a referral fee of 10,000 RMB after successfully joining the job. However, the problem of headhunting channels is that the quality of resumes is very high, and those with a well-known company background can easily make orders; the repayment period is particularly long. Generally, it is necessary to get the full referral fee after the probationary period has passed.

## Available payment interfaces

At present, there are many formal service providers that provide payment to individuals, and WeChat also has [small and micro merchants] (https://pay.weixin.qq.com/index.php/core/affiliate/micro_intro). Here are a few, I have not used it myself, only for information, not recommended.

## Summary

Learning to make money is a very important thing, it will let you understand how business works, help you understand the company's product logic, and lay a solid foundation for your possible technology entrepreneurship.

So I encourage everyone to earn more pocket money, it is best to try all kinds of postures, there will be unexpected fun.
If you have better pocket money skills, you are welcome to send PR, I will pick a good merge :)
